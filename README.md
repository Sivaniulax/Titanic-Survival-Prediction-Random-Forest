# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Random-Forest
This repository contains code that demonstrates the use of a Random Forest classifier to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.

Overview
The code in this repository performs the following tasks:

Loads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.
Preprocesses the data by dropping irrelevant columns, filling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Applies feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Trains a Random Forest classifier on the training set.
Evaluates the model's performance on the testing set by calculating accuracy and generating a classification report.
Visualizes the confusion matrix heatmap using Plotly.
Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Place the Titanic dataset CSV file (e.g., titanic.csv) in the same directory as the code file.
Run the code using a Python interpreter (e.g., python main.py).
Observe the accuracy, classification report, and the confusion matrix heatmap generated by the code.
Requirements
The code requires the following dependencies:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
plotly
You can install these dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Data
The Titanic dataset (titanic.csv) used in this code contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features such as age, sex, fare, and survival outcome.
